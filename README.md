This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving the use of raw pointers and mutable vectors. The `bug.rs` file showcases the problem: directly manipulating a vector's contents through a raw pointer after the vector has potentially been reallocated can cause data corruption or crashes. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.rs`, illustrates safer memory management practices within Rust.  The solution avoids raw pointer usage by employing the safer methods and functionalities of Rust's standard library, preventing unexpected behavior.
